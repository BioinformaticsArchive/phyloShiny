README file for all binomials in tol

This is a subset of the names in the "all node names" file (separate).  They were parsed via unix tools directly from the XML file TOL.xml available from the phylotastic wiki (presumably this comes directly from ToLWeb).  

I simply took all the names that had the <Uppercase word><space><lowercase words> pattern.  These names are not filtered in any other way, except for fixing a non-ASCII character in one of the names.
